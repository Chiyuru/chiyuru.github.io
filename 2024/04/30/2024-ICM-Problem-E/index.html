<h1 id="summary">Summary</h1>
<p>The growing threat of frequent meteorological disasters is
endangeringour planet. To promote the healthy development of the
insurance industry, we established an <strong>Insurance Model</strong>
to measure the impact of weather disasters, and implemented gradient
insurance policies in two different regions. We have also established a
<strong>Landmark Preservation Model</strong> and proposed relocation
suggestions for the <strong>Vizcaya Museum and Gardens</strong> to
evaluate preservation measure, and protect people's beloved
landmarks.</p>
<p>Firstly, we utilized <strong>Entropy Weight Method</strong> to assess
hurricane disaster risk in <strong>Florida</strong> and rainstorm
disaster risk in <strong>Indonesia</strong>. We constructed a climate
risk index (WDRI) with universality in meteorological aspects.
Subsequently, we respectively employed <strong>ARIMA</strong> and
<strong>prophet models</strong> to forecast the <strong>Style Risk
Factor</strong> for both regions. Conducting single-factor analysis and
multivariate analysis at both the logical and empirical levels, we
eliminated or equally weighted factors where risk exposure was not
significant, negatively impacting the goodness of fit (<span class="math inline">\(\textbf{R}^2 &gt; \textbf{0.98}\)</span>), and VIF
indicators (final <span class="math inline">\(\textbf{VIF} &lt;
\textbf{2}\)</span>) of the model. Following this, we performed multiple
regressions of premium pricing on several factors, achieving a model
confidence level of over <span class="math inline">\(\textbf{90}
\textbf{\%}\)</span>.</p>
<p>Furthermore, we devised <strong>graded underwriting
strategies</strong> and obtained a baseline CDVI for insurance companies
targeting regions experiencing an increasing frequency of extreme
weather events. Under the condition of maintaining the <strong>loss
ratio</strong> for insurance companies <strong>among</strong> <span class="math inline">\(\textbf{60}\textbf{\%}\)</span>
<strong>to</strong> <span class="math inline">\(\textbf{100}\textbf{\%}\)</span>, we aimed to
minimize the <strong>insurance protection gap</strong> to the greatest
extent possible.</p>
<p>Then, based on the premium pricing result of the insurance model and
climate risk index (WDRI), we incorporated repair costs to provide a
<strong>multiple linear regression</strong> calculation method and
theoretical explanation for the <strong>Local Livability Index</strong>
(LVI). Furthermore, we presented different land use scenarios under
various LVI conditions, making it possible to better utilize land
resources in the context of population growth.</p>
<p>Afterwards, by understanding the assessment scheme for historic
landmarks in the latest <strong>MAHT model</strong>, we established the
Landmark Preservation Model based on four indicators: historical and
cultural significance, resident satisfaction, disaster risk measurement
WDRI, and building damage level. We developed a <strong>decision
flowchart</strong> for implementing protection measures for landmark
buildings under different circumstances.</p>
<p>Finally, we used this model with <strong>over</strong> <strong>60
sub-indicators</strong> to evaluate the protection measures for the
<strong>Vizcaya Museum and Gardens</strong> in Miami, with a WDRI of
<strong>0.825</strong> thus cannot be insured. By calculating the
corresponding Landmark Weather Disaster Vulnerability Index (LWDVI) as
<strong>2.554</strong>, which indicates a relatively high level, we
identified the need for relocation due to the inability to implement
adequate protection measures and the predicted future submergence. A
community letter was also written accordingly.</p>

<h1 id="introduction">Introduction</h1>
<h2 id="problem-background">Problem Background</h2>
<p>Climate change is leading to an increase in the frequency and
severity of extreme weather events across the globe. This phenomenon has
profound implications for property owners, insurers and communities. The
cost of damages from natural disasters is skyrocketing, leading to
escalating insurance premiums and, in some cases, insurers withdrawing
coverage altogether in high-risk areas. This crisis threatens the
affordability of homeownership and the financial stability of the
insurance industry.</p>
<p>To cope with challenges brought by climate change, it's important to
seek methodologies to guide decision-making for both insurance companies
and community leaders. The overarching goal is to promote a sustainable
property insurance system that balances the need for affordable coverage
with the long-term viability of insurance providers, all while
considering the preservation of communities and their cultural
heritage.</p>
<h2 id="restatement-of-the-tasks">Restatement of the Tasks</h2>
<p>Considering the background information and restricted conditions
identified in the problem statement, we need to solve the following
tasks:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Task 1</strong>: Develop an index to measure the risk of
meteorological disasters in a given location with historical data.
Determine the factors of the insurance model. Devise a rule to obtain
the insurance coverage provided by an insurance company in a particular
region.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Task 2</strong>: Utilize this index to measure the risk
of specific disaster losses in two different continents (we select
Florida in the United States and Indonesia), calculate and predict
future premiums, and assist insurance companies in determining the
coverage scope of insurance services.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Task 3</strong>: Apply the developed insurance model to
assist community decision-makers in planning future property
construction, including site selection, construction techniques, and
other aspects in a future where the local population continues to grow
and faces increasing meteorological uncertainties.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Task 4</strong>: Compare the costs and social value of
protecting buildings by estimating the economic and cultural value of
buildings within a community, and using existing indexes to assess the
severity of disasters.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="our-work">Our Work</h2>
<p>To address the multi-dimensional estimation problem in such a complex
system, we referenced a large amount of relevant work and established
two models: the Insurance Model and the Landmark Preservation Model. The
schematic diagram of our study is shown in Figure 1. First, we
constructed a measure called WDRI to reflect the severity level of
meteorological disasters in a region. The WDRI was obtained through
standardizing data related to specific meteorological disaster factors
and applying the Entropy Weight Method. Next, we used this measure along
with Section/Style Risk Factors to develop a model for predicting
changes in local insurance costs using multiple linear regression and
prophet. Based on this model, we devised a method for calculating
insurance premiums in different regions for insurance companies.</p>
<p>Subsequently, we demonstrated this model using examples from two
different regions and designed a new measure called LVI, which helps
real estate companies determine the geographical location for property
development and strategies for development in various locations based on
empirical rules from relevant literature. Finally, by referencing
relevant literature, we utilized the MAHT model <a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> to
design a measure, LV, for calculating the value of landmark buildings.
By combining the previously obtained WDRI, we calculated a measure,
LCDVR, for determining the protection needed for landmark buildings, and
established a decision-making flowchart for protection measures to
assist decision-makers.</p>

<h1 id="assumptions-and-justifications">Assumptions and
Justifications</h1>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Assumption</strong>: The average housing rental prices
and insurance premiums in an area change proportionally at the same
time.</p>
<p><strong>Justification</strong>: During severe disasters, risks are
generally positively correlated with property values. Therefore, using
the average rental prices in the housing market to represent insurance
premiums is considered a reasonable proxy.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Assumption</strong>: The duration of the hurricane
exhibits an exponential relationship with the pressure difference (<span class="math inline">\(P_{normal} - P_{min}\)</span>).</p>
<p><strong>Justification</strong>: We assume that the process of
pressure recovery in the hurricane center from its minimum to normal
pressure follows the Exponential Decay equation<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a>
<span class="math inline">\(P(t) = P + (P_{normal} - P) \times (1 -
exp(-t \tau))\)</span>, where <span class="math inline">\(P(t)\)</span>
denotes pressure at time t, <span class="math inline">\(P_{min}\)</span>
represents the minimum pressure in the center of the hurricane, <span class="math inline">\(P_{normal}\)</span> is the normal pressure, and
<span class="math inline">\(\tau\)</span> is the time constant
characterizing the rate of pressure recovery. Also, we assume that <span class="math inline">\(\tau\)</span> remains consistent across
hurricanes.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Assumption</strong>: The residents' satisfaction and
local viability index (LVI) in an area change proportionally at the same
time.</p>
<p><strong>Justification</strong>: Recent studies show that the life
satisfaction of local residents is mainly related to community density,
population size, economic development level, age distribution of
residents, and per capita income<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a>. These factors can be
approximated as measures of the local viability index (LVI) and used as
such after standardization<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a>. This is consistent with
common sense, as there is a very high correlation between residents'
satisfaction and the livability of an area.</p></li>

<p>We can categorize risk pricing performance into the following four
implications:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong>Return Forecast</strong>: Formulating reasonable and
effective predictions of returns.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Process Control</strong>: Monitoring the entire insurance
premium pricing process to maintain consistency between pricing and
actual production.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Cost Control</strong>: Avoiding excessive or inefficient
transactions.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Risk Control</strong>: Capturing market opportunities
under prudent considerations.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Taking into account various factors, we can express the claims risk
in the following multiple-factor model, and is interpreted more vividly
in</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\text{insurance price} = \sum_{k=1}^n
\beta_k x_k +\varepsilon\]</span></p>
<p>In the model, <span class="math inline">\(x_k\)</span> represents the
original values of the factors, <span class="math inline">\(\beta_k\)</span> represents the risk exposure of
insurance price to the <span class="math inline">\(x_k\)</span> factor,
and <span class="math inline">\(\varepsilon\)</span> is the model
residual. Moreover, in the premium pricing model there are three
categories of risk factors: climate risk factors, sector risk factors,
and style risk factors (see Figure 3).</p>
<p><img src="https://s2.loli.net/2024/02/06/iLPfYuHtSIaNxTZ.png" alt="2-3.png"></p>
<p>The <strong>Weather Disaster Risk Factor</strong> reflects the
severity of certain or multiple meteorological disasters on the local
area. This should be quantified by collecting relevant historical data
on disasters and analyzing potential influencing factors
specifically.</p>
<p>The <strong>Sector Risk Factor</strong> mainly include the
characteristics of the insured property, such as the structure of
buildings, materials used, construction age, etc. In other words, we can
assess insurance prices based on the nature of the insured property.
Logically, this assumption is plausible. For example, concerning the
construction age, older buildings are more susceptible to damage,
leading to higher compensations for the property. In subsequent
empirical verification, the establishment of dummy variables for factors
like building materials, structure, and construction age being greater
than a specific reference value to access the overall risk
characteristics of insured buildings in a region.</p>
<p>The third category of factors is <strong>Style Risk Factors</strong>,
including population density, population age, regional gross domestic
product (GDP), and other elements. Logically, we can understand that a
region with a higher population density often indicates a higher level
of economic development and more concentrated housing, resulting in more
assets affected by disasters, which should lead to higher premiums. The
same reasoning applies to factors like GDP. However, it is worth noting
that these factors may exhibit multicollinearity, leading to potentially
inflated estimates of correlation.</p>
<p>After establishing the premium pricing model, we can conduct a
cost-benefit analysis for insurance companies and determine underwriting
policies and reference standards based on the risk index and regional
economic development. The first evaluation metric is the WDRI, and the
second is the loss ratio (LRT) defined as follows:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[LRT = \frac{\text{Losses
Incured}}{\text{Earned Premium}} \times 100 \%.\]</span></p>
<p>According to relevant surveys, residents' insurance expenses are
roughly around <span class="math inline">\(5\%\)</span> of their average
personal income. Therefore, if, under a given disaster risk scenario,
the predicted premium (denoted as predicted price) exceeds <span class="math inline">\(5\%\)</span> of the average personal income, it is
recommended that the insurance company refrains from underwriting in
that region. The rationale is that residents in that area are likely to
perceive the insurance cost as excessively high, discouraging them from
purchasing insurance.</p>
<p>After obtaining the residents' insurance expenses, we can apply it to
the insurance model and inversely get the corresponding baseline WDRI
(BWDRI). It is advised that the insurance company does not underwrite in
areas with higher WDRI than the baseline.</p>
<p>To access the recommend policies concretely, the loss ratio (LRT)
should be taken into consideration. The lower the value of the loss
ratio, the better the performance of the insurance company in claims
handling.Generally, the profitability of insurance companies relies on
accurate pricing and claims management. If the loss ratio doesn't exceed
<span class="math inline">\(100\%\)</span>, the insurance company has a
surplus in claims expenditures, meaning there is a remainder between the
received premiums and the claims paid, and is acceptable.</p>
<h1 id="application-of-the-insurance-model-in-two-areas">Application of
the Insurance Model in Two Areas</h1>
<p>To illustrate our model, we have selected two regions, Indonesia in
Asia and Florida State in North America, for analysis. Florida is known
to be prone to hurricanes, while Indonesia is susceptible to rainstorms
and earthquakes.</p>
<h2 id="analysis-of-florida-state-usa">Analysis of Florida State,
USA</h2>
<h3 id="background">Background</h3>
<p>Florida is located in the northwestern part of the Atlantic Ocean and
is frequently affected by weather disasters. Home insurance costs in
Florida are increasing substantially, causing concern among
propertyowners, community managers, and potential buyers about the
future of the insurance market in the state.</p>
<p>Among the weather disasters affecting Florida, the most severe ones
are hurricanes. According to data collected by the National Oceanic and
Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), a heat map (see Figure 4) and a
histogram (see Figure 5) both reveal that the severity of hurricane
damage in Florida in the eastern United States is extremely strong.</p>
<p><img src="https://s2.loli.net/2024/02/06/vlxWpu2qr7Dmdyh.png" alt="4-5.png"></p>
<h3 id="conclusions-obtained-by-insurance-model">Conclusions Obtained by
Insurance Model</h3>
<p>Firstly, we construct the Weather Disaster Risk Index (WDRI) to
quantify the <strong>Climate Risk Disaster Factor</strong>. Data on
hurricane trajectories of Northern Atlantic from 1994-2022 was
collected, where Radius of Maximum Wind (<span class="math inline">\(r_i\)</span>, in nautical miles) ,Minimum Pressure
(<span class="math inline">\(p\)</span>, in millibars) ,Maximum
sustained wind (<span class="math inline">\(w\)</span>, in knots) and
temperature (<span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>, in Fahrenheit
degrees) are known. Normalization was applied to the data in order to
balance discrepancies among different measurement units.</p>
<p>The WDRI is accessed through Entropy Weight Method, which determines
the weight of each coefficients. The desired model construction is as
follows<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5" role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a>:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[WDRI = r_i^2 \times (\log (p_0 - p_i)+
c_1 \times t) \times w_i^3\]</span></p>
<p>We assume that <span class="math inline">\(r^2\)</span> is
proportional to the hurricane's force range and <span class="math inline">\(\log(p_0-p_i)\)</span> is proportional to the
hurricane's duration. Furthermore, given that a hurricane is powered by
the condensation from heat, <span class="math inline">\(c_1 \times
t\)</span> is used to represent the weakening effect of low temperatures
on the hurricane. The wind force (F) is proportional to the cube of the
wind speed (V), i.e., <span class="math inline">\(F\propto
w^3\)</span>.</p>
<p>Given the climate data of each area in the Florida State, we can
calculate the WDRI index for various regions in the state of Florida. At
the same time, by collecting data on the local population (pop), average
age (age), and GDP to represent the Style Risk Factor, and assuming the
use of local real estate rental prices as the insurance cost indicator,
we can use a multiple linear regression model to estimate and predict
insurance costs.</p>
<p>Now try to identify the effectiveness of the factors by conducting a
correlation analysis among the existing factor sequences (see Figure
6).</p>
<p><img src="https://s2.loli.net/2024/02/06/dwGmJ5Xal8fPKj4.png" alt="6.png"></p>
<p>All four factors exhibit relatively high correlations with insurance
prices, indicating predictive potential. Notably, the correlation
between pop and age is remarkably high at 0.9881, and the correlations
among pop, age, and GDP all exceed 0.9. In light of these high
correlations, we may consider synthesizing these factors for subsequent
calculations.</p>
<p>If we proceed with a multiple regression using the four factors
directly, the model's <span class="math inline">\(R^2\)</span> is close
to <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span>, indicating an excellent fit.
However the average <span class="math inline">\(VIF\)</span> for this
model exceeds <span class="math inline">\(10\)</span>, suggesting the
possibility of multicollinearity among factors.</p>
<p>By continuously adjusting the number of factors and interaction
relationships in the model, we ultimately obtain the model:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\text{insurance price} = 19591.13 +
255.7892 WDRI - 496.4459 age + 2.34 \times 10^{-6} GDP +
\varepsilon.\]</span></p>
<p>Its advantage lies in minimizing the <span class="math inline">\(VIF\)</span> value as much as possible, thereby
eliminating the impact of multicollinearity on the model. At the same
time, as a trade-off, there is a slight decrease in the <span class="math inline">\(R^2\)</span> value, but it does not greatly affect
the power of explanation.</p>
<p>By individually predicting the values for each factor and then using
the above model to calculate the predicted price, we obtain the results
shown in the following table:</p>

<p>The bias between the predicted price obtained from the model and the
officially predicted insurance price is approximately <span class="math inline">\(3\%\)</span>, within an acceptable margin of
error. Therefore, we consider the model pricing to be effective.</p>
<p>Based on statistical data, the typical annual income for residents in
Florida is <span class="math inline">\(\$52,000\)</span> USD. Using this
data, with <span class="math inline">\(5\%\)</span> as the maximum
predicted premium value, the regression model calculates that the WDRI
should be less than or equal to <span class="math inline">\(0.74\)</span>.</p>
<p>In cases where the predicted premium price is greater than <span class="math inline">\(1\%\)</span> but less than <span class="math inline">\(5\%\)</span> of the average annual income, the
corresponding storm risk range should be between <span class="math inline">\(0.34\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(0.74\)</span>. It is recommended that the
insurance company can maintain a loss ratio below <span class="math inline">\(100 \%\)</span> (profitable) and selectively
decrease the loss ratio, for example, setting it at <span class="math inline">\(60\%\)</span>. Under this standard, the insurance
company can introduce an insurance product: charging <span class="math inline">\(\$492\)</span> USD per square meter of property at
one time and paying a premium of <span class="math inline">\(\$1560\)</span> USD during a five-year insurance
period.</p>
<p>In situations where the predicted premium price is less than <span class="math inline">\(1\%\)</span> of the average annual income, the
corresponding WDRI is less than <span class="math inline">\(0.34\)</span>, indicating a lower probability of
hurricanes damage. In such cases, the insurance company slightly
increase the loss ratio to enhance its commercial competitiveness, for
instance, setting the loss ratio at <span class="math inline">\(70\%\)</span>. Under this standard, the insurance
company can introduce an insurance product: charging <span class="math inline">\(\$162\)</span> USD per square meter of property at
one time and paying a premium of <span class="math inline">\(\$520\)</span> USD during a five-year insurance
period.</p>
<p>It is important to note that in a specific market environment,
insurance companies may adopt different strategies to adjust the loss
ratio to maintain competitiveness and profitability.</p>
<p>Crucially, a low loss ratio is not always favorable, as it may
indicate the company is overly conservative in risk assessment, leading
to excessively high premium pricing and potential loss of
competitiveness. Also, the establishment of the loss ratio also
reflects, to some extent, the social responsibility of insurance
companies. In areas where residents' annual income is relatively low, we
recommend insurance companies adopt a higher loss ratio insurance policy
to help reduce <strong>Insurance Protection Gap</strong> for vulnerable
people in disasters. This policy not only yields the effect of profits
but also helps to establish the responsible social image of the
insurance company, contributing to the sustainable development of the
enterprise.</p>
<h2 id="analysis-of-indonesia">Analysis of Indonesia</h2>
<h3 id="background-1">Background</h3>
<p>Indonesia, a country made up of thousands of islands, is prone to
severe rainstorm disasters due to its location. The country experiences
frequent flooding, land-slides, and other related disasters, which lead
to destruction to infrastructure, homes, and agricultural land, as well
as loss of lives and displacement of communities. (see Figure 7, 8)</p>

<h3 id="conclusions-obtained-by-insurance-model-1">Conclusions Obtained
by Insurance Model</h3>
<p>We continue to employ a multi-factor model to assess the predicted
insurance premium pricing situation in Indonesia. In the design of this
model, we incorporate three factors to evaluate insurance prices
(substituting Property Prices for Indonesia as the dependent variable,
take Index <span class="math inline">\(2010=100\)</span>), namely WDRI
again, GDP, and population.</p>
<p>First, we create the Weather Disaster Risk Index (WDRI) to quantify
the factors related to Climate Risk Disaster. Indonesia daily climate
data from 2010 to 2022 were gathered to calculate it, focusing on key
factors including the average humidity (<span class="math inline">\(RH_{avg}\)</span>, in %), rainfall (<span class="math inline">\(RR\)</span>, in mm), average temperature (<span class="math inline">\(T_{avg}\)</span>, in degrees of Celsius), average
wind speed (<span class="math inline">\(ff_{avg}\)</span>) and duration
of sunshine (<span class="math inline">\(ss\)</span>, in hour).
Standardization was applied during data processing.</p>
<p>Firstly, <span class="math inline">\(RR\)</span> (rainfall data) is
directly related to floods according to common sense. Secondly, we
investigated the relationship between Temperature and Rainfall, finding
that rainfall peaked near 26 degrees Celsius, so we took <span class="math inline">\(|T_{avg}-26|\)</span> as a related influencing
factor (see Figure 9). According to online materials<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6" role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a>,
there is a positive correlation between cloud cover and floods. Assuming
the appearance of clouds is negatively correlated with sunlight, we
built -<span class="math inline">\(ss\)</span> as a positively
correlated factor. The desired model construction is as follows:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[WDRI = c(\alpha |T_{avg}-26| + \beta
(-ss) + \gamma RH_{avg} + \sigma ff_{avg})RR.\]</span></p>
<p>Where <span class="math inline">\(c\)</span> is the scaling factor,
<span class="math inline">\(RR\)</span> is considered as a key factor
indicating the amount of rainfall, and <span class="math inline">\(|T_{avg}-26|\)</span> is applied with reference to
the statistical information shown in Figure 9 that rainfall has a peak
distribution around <span class="math inline">\(26 ^\text{o}\)</span>C.
<span class="math inline">\(\alpha , \beta , \gamma ,\sigma\)</span> are
coefficients to be determined by Entropy Weight Method. The coefficients
obtained are:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\alpha = 0.303696, \beta=0.239401 ,
\gamma=0.186802 ,\sigma=0.270101.\]</span></p>
<p>Given the climate data of each area in Indonesia, we can calculate
the WDRI index for various regions here. At the same time, by collecting
data on the local population (pop) and GDP to represent the Style Risk
Factor, and assuming the use of property price as the insurance cost
indicator, we can use a multiple linear regression model to estimate and
predict insurance costs.</p>
<p>Now try to identify the effectiveness of the factors by conducting a
correlation analysis among the existing factor sequences (see Figure
10).</p>
<p><img src="https://s2.loli.net/2024/02/06/u8iQGmlg15sntax.png" alt="9-10.png"></p>
<p>We observe a relatively low correlation between the climate factor
and the dependent variable, suggesting that it may be considered for
exclusion in the regression analysis. The GDP and population factors
exhibit a high correlation, indicating a potential issue of
multicollinearity. In our empirical testing, we will monitor the
Variance Inflation Factor (VIF) values to address this concern.
Regarding the heteroscedasticity of the model, we will not consider it
in the prediction problem at the moment.</p>
<p>When attempting to model predictions simultaneously with all three
factors, we find that the risk exposure on the dependent variable
concerning the GDP factor is not significant. Additionally, the GDP
factor contributes significantly to the VIF. Therefore, we initially
exclude the GDP factor. Subsequently, we conduct a regression using the
climate and population factors, resulting in the following model:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\text{insurance price} = -78.36633 WDRI
+6.69 \times 10^{-6} population - 1026.793+ \varepsilon.\]</span></p>
<p>The average <span class="math inline">\(VIF = 1.10\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(R^2 = 0.9831\)</span>, indicates a good fit of the
model without severe multicollinearity.</p>
<p>Then we utilize the prophet model to forecast future values for
population and property prices. Comparing these forecasts with the
predicted prices calculated using the insurance model, we obtain the
bias as presented in the following table:</p>

<p>Therefore we have at least <span class="math inline">\(90\%\)</span>
confident that the model is accurate and reasonable.</p>
<p>Statistical data indicates that the per capita GDP of Indonesia in
2022 was <span class="math inline">\(\$4,788\)</span>, and a reasonable
estimate for future per capita GDP is around <span class="math inline">\(\$5,000\)</span>. In a given risk scenario, if the
predicted premium (represented as the predicted price) exceeds <span class="math inline">\(5\%\)</span> of the average personal income, it is
recommended that the insurance company refrains from underwriting in
that region.</p>
<p>Using <span class="math inline">\(5\%\)</span> as the maximum
predicted premium value, the regression model calculates that the
climate risk index should be less than or equal to <span class="math inline">\(0.82\)</span>. This data suggests that if the
calculated climate risk index for a province in Indonesia exceeds <span class="math inline">\(0.82\)</span>, it is advisable for the insurance
company to abstain from underwriting in that region.</p>
<p>In cases where the predicted premium price is greater than <span class="math inline">\(1\%\)</span> but less than <span class="math inline">\(5\%\)</span> of the average annual income, the
corresponding risk index range should be between <span class="math inline">\(0.48\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(0.82\)</span>. It is recommended that the
insurance company selectively lowers the loss ratio, keeping it below
<span class="math inline">\(100 \%\)</span> (profitable), for example,
setting it at <span class="math inline">\(60\%\)</span>. Under this
standard, the insurance company can introduce an insurance product:
charging <span class="math inline">\(\$38\)</span> per square meter of
property at one time and paying a premium of <span class="math inline">\(\$150\)</span> during a five-year insurance
period.</p>
<p>In situations where the predicted premium price is less than <span class="math inline">\(1\%\)</span> of the average annual income, the
corresponding risk index range is less than <span class="math inline">\(0.48\)</span>, indicating a lower probability of
rainstorm disasters. In such cases, it is suggested that the insurance
company slightly increases the loss ratio to enhance its commercial
competitiveness in the regional insurance industry, for instance,
setting the loss ratio at <span class="math inline">\(70\%\)</span>.
Under this standard, the insurance company can introduce an insurance
product: charging <span class="math inline">\(\$12\)</span> per square
meter of property at one time and paying a premium of <span class="math inline">\(\$50\)</span> during a five-year insurance
period.</p>
<p>Crucially, a low loss ratio is not always favorable, as it may
indicate the company is overly conservative in risk assessment, leading
to excessively high premium pricing and potential loss of
competitiveness. Also, the establishment of the loss ratio also
reflects, to some extent, the social responsibility of insurance
companies. In areas like Indonesia where residents' annual income is
relatively low with respective to the world average, we recommend
insurance companies adopt a higher loss ratio insurance policy to help
reduce <strong>Insurance Protection Gap</strong> for vulnerable people
in disasters. This policy not only yields the effect of profits but also
helps to establish the responsible social image of the insurance
company, contributing to the sustainable development of the
enterprise.</p>
<h1 id="applications-to-building-sites-choices">Applications to Building

<p>We aim to establish a multifactorial indicator called the Location
Viability Index (LVI) to assess whether an area is suitable for
developing real estate projects and for living. The three main
influencing factors are as follows:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Weather Disaster Risk Index (WDRI) evaluated in the insurance
model, which quantifies the disaster risk for each location;</p></li>
<li><p>Recommended insurance premium plan for insurance companies
according to the insurance model (IPP: No insurance / High Premium / Low
Premium);</p></li>
<li><p>Projected costs of repairs/rebuilds under potential climate event
scenarios (RC).</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Recent studies show that the life satisfaction of local residents is
mainly related to community density, population size, economic
development level, age distribution of residents, and per capita
income<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7" role="doc-noteref"><sup>7</sup></a>. These factors can be approximated
as measures of the local viability index (LVI) and used as such after
standardization<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8" role="doc-noteref"><sup>8</sup></a>. This is consistent with common
sense, as there is a very high correlation between residents'
satisfaction and the livability of an area. Therefore, a linear
regression model for LVI can be established based on the above three
influencing factors:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[LVI = b_0 + b_1 WDRI + b_2 IPP + b_3 RC
+ \varepsilon\]</span></p>
<p>Where IPP is an integer variable as being <span class="math inline">\(0\)</span> for no insurance case, <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span> for high insurance and <span class="math inline">\(2\)</span> for low insurance according to the
insurance model. <span class="math inline">\(b_0, b_1 ,b_2, b_3\)</span>
are coefficients to be estimated according to the dataset.</p>
<p>After obtaining a Location Viability Index that can fit the actual
situation well, it can be used to estimate the livability of various
areas, and they can be divided into livable and non-livable areas under
meteorological disasters according to proportion.</p>
<p>Livable areas need to be prioritized and appropriately developed to
accommodate future population growth, with specific measures
including:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Construct higher-density residential communities with supporting
facilities;</p></li>
<li><p>Negotiate with insurance companies and communities to reach
cooperation agreements to reduce the residential insurance costs in the
area, thereby lowering the living cost and attracting
residents.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>In the ongoing urban development, the area will be transformed into a
vibrant community, where abundant facilities can meet the resources
needed for population growth.</p>
<p>For regions that are not suitable enough for living, large-scale
vacant land can be developed for tourism and open during disaster-free
seasons. Local managers should ensure daily warning and management work,
driving the economic development of the local area, and compensating for
possible losses caused by weather disasters.</p>
<p>The standards should be re-evaluated every 3-5 years as new risk
assessments and climate impact projections are available. This allows
development guidelines to adapt.</p>
<h1 id="landmark-preservation-model">Landmark Preservation Model</h1>
<h2 id="value-of-landmark">Value of Landmark</h2>
<p>We construct a metric to quantify the value of each landmark first.
According to existing study <a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9" role="doc-noteref"><sup>9</sup></a>, this mainly includes
two aspects, heritage attributes and residential satisfaction (for the
corresponding MAHT model, see Figure 11). Also, these two indicators are
<strong>complementary</strong> as the Pincipal Component Analysis result
shows that these two together can explain <span class="math inline">\(74.64 \%\)</span> of variance according to the
study <a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10" role="doc-noteref"><sup>10</sup></a>.</p>
<p><img src="https://s2.loli.net/2024/02/06/GLxCZUeQNMSqWOJ.png" alt="11.png"></p>
<p>On the other hand, this approach is reasonable for our research.
Firstly, we discuss landmark historical buildings, which often have
important <strong>historical and cultural significance</strong>. For
example, they may have an exquisite structure or a long history. In
addition, they carry the memories of residents and have strong
<strong>emotional values</strong> of residents. People are proud to have
such a landmark building in their place of residence and love it
wholeheartedly. This is also the important value and significance of
protecting such community historical landmark buildings.</p>
<p>Therefore, we need to consider this issue from these two aspects:
heritage attributes and residential satisfaction. To facilitate the
subsequent calculations, we introduce the following symbols to represent
the main indicators:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[(LV, PC2, PC3, HA1, HA2, HA3, HA, RS1,
RS2, RS3, RS)\]</span></p>
<p>Where <span class="math inline">\(LV\)</span> represents the value of
the landmark, and <span class="math inline">\(PC2, PC3\)</span>
represent the 2nd and 3rd principal components. <span class="math inline">\(HA, HA1,HA2,HA3\)</span> are heritage attribute
with its sub-level variables, and <span class="math inline">\(RS,
RS1,RS2,RS3\)</span> are residential satisfaction with its sub-level
variables. We approximately describe the result of <span class="math inline">\(PC2, PC3\)</span> as linear combinations of the
main indicators in terms according to the results in the study <a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11" role="doc-noteref"><sup>11</sup></a>:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\begin{gathered}
      PC2 = 0.89 HA1 +0.939 HA2 + 0.887 HA3 + 0.971 HA \\
      PC3 = 0.471 RS1 + 0.604 RS2 + 0.67 RS3 + 0.806 RS
\end{gathered}\]</span></p>
<p>The existing results <a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12" role="doc-noteref"><sup>12</sup></a> show that principal
component 2 and principal component 3 can represent the two parts of
heritage attributes and residential satisfaction indicators,
respectively. Therefore, we can set the value of landmark architecture
as the sum of the two principal components, which can explain <span class="math inline">\(37.45\%\)</span> of the variance and has a strong
explanatory power. Thus the value of the landmark can be set as the sum
of both principle components: <span class="math display">\[LV = PC2
+PC3\]</span> Note that according to existing research results <a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13" role="doc-noteref"><sup>13</sup></a>, the calculation of various
indicators for <span class="math inline">\(HA\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(RS\)</span> involves a weighted summation of 31
sub-indicators, which is relatively complex and lengthy. The specific
calculation method can be found in Appendix 1, which is not provided in
detail here.</p>
<h2 id="risks-of-landmark">Risks of Landmark</h2>
<p>The risks that landmark buildings may face need to be considered in
two parts. Firstly, there are inherent risks associated with the
building itself, such as erosion of building materials or existing
structural damage, which can lead to damage to the landmark under
extreme weather conditions.</p>
<p>In addition, the external risks of meteorological disasters that the
building's location may face should also be taken into account. This is
because the landmark buildings considered are located in regions where
insurance companies perceive a higher risk of meteorological disasters,
thus requiring the inclusion of meteorological disaster risks in the
assessment. For the sake of consistency and generality, the Weather
Disaster Risk Index established earlier can be directly used as an
evaluation indicator.</p>
<p>For the inherent risks of landmark buildings, existing research <a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14" role="doc-noteref"><sup>14</sup></a> indicates that the MAHT model can
still be used, and the first principal component PC1 from the model can
be used as a risk indicator. Therefore, we need to consider this issue
from these two aspects: heritage attributes and residential
satisfaction. To facilitate the subsequent calculations, we introduce
the following symbols to represent the main indicators:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[(LIR, PC1, SC1, SC2, SC3, SC,
OI)\]</span></p>
<p>Where <span class="math inline">\(LIR\)</span> represents the
inherent risk of the landmark, and <span class="math inline">\(PC1\)</span> represents the first principal
component. <span class="math inline">\(SC, SC1, SC2, SC3\)</span> are
safety conditions with sub-level variables. Moreover, <span class="math inline">\(OI\)</span> is the third layer variable of the
MAHT model. We approximately describe the result of <span class="math inline">\(PC1\)</span> as linear combinations of the main
indicators in terms according to the results in the study <a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15" role="doc-noteref"><sup>15</sup></a>:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[PC1 = 0.749 SC1 + 0.729 SC2 + 0.76 SC3 +
0.874 SC + 0.908 OI\]</span></p>
<p>The existing results <a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16" role="doc-noteref"><sup>16</sup></a> show that principal
component 1 can represent the safety condition of the landmark.
Therefore, we can set the inherent risk of the landmark as the first
principal component, which can explain <span class="math inline">\(37.19\%\)</span> of the variance and has the
strongest explanatory power.</p>
<h2 id="landmark-weather-disaster-vulnerability-index">Landmark Weather
Disaster Vulnerability Index</h2>
<p>Note that regarding the indicators related to landmark risk and
landmark value mentioned earlier, <span class="math inline">\(PC1\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(PC2\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\(PC3\)</span> come from the same evaluation system
and therefore need to be standardized collectively before calculations,
where the maximum value normalization method is adopted. The
standardized results are respectively denoted as <span class="math inline">\(PC1^{&#39;}\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(PC2^{&#39;}\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\(PC3^{&#39;}\)</span>. The calculation method is as
follows:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\begin{gathered}
    PC1^{&#39;} = \frac{PC1}{\max \{ PC1, PC2, PC3\}} \\
    PC2^{&#39;} = \frac{PC2}{\max \{ PC1, PC2, PC3\}} \\
    PC3^{&#39;} = \frac{PC3}{\max \{ PC1, PC2, PC3\}}.
\end{gathered}\]</span></p>
<p>Moreover, the Weather Disaster Risk Index (WDRI) is already
standardized data and can be calculated directly. Therefore, the final
calculation formula for the Landmark Weather Disaster Vulnerability
Index (LWDVI) is:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[LWDVI = (PC2^{&#39;} +PC3^{&#39;})\times
(WDRI +PC1^{&#39;}).\]</span></p>
<p>Similarly, the standardized result of value of landmark (<span class="math inline">\(LV\)</span>) can be interpreted as:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[LV^{\prime} = PC2^{&#39;}
+PC3^{&#39;}.\]</span></p>
<h2 id="construction-of-landmark-preservation-model">Construction of
Landmark Preservation Model</h2>
<p>Existing research <a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17" role="doc-noteref"><sup>17</sup></a> shows that after obtaining the
above indicators, decisions can be made based on the satisficing model,
making the decision results closest to reality and easiest for policy
implementation. The following decision flowchart (see Figure 12) can
well reflect our recommended decision-making approach.</p>
<p><img src="https://s2.loli.net/2024/02/06/7TLGFwCJa2WkKyg.png" alt="12.png"></p>
<p>This decision flowchart provides various protection schemes for
landmarks with different values and varying internal and external risk
levels. The decision-maker also needs to consider factors such as budget
and available funds and use the landmark preservation model to determine
the appropriate protection measures for the landmark.</p>
<h2 id="application-to-vizcaya-museum-and-gardens">Application to
Vizcaya Museum and Gardens</h2>
<h3 id="background-2">Background</h3>
<p>The Vizcaya Museum and Gardens, a historic landmark in Miami,
Florida, faces significant threats from hurricanes and other natural
disasters. The estate has faced numerous hurricanes over the years,
including Hurricane Irma in 2017. While the property experienced huge
damage, the potential impact of future storms remains a significant
concern.</p>
<p>To make matters worse, with a calculated WDRI of <span class="math inline">\(0.825\)</span> for Miami and the baseline WDRI as
<span class="math inline">\(0.74\)</span>, it is advised that the
insurance company does not underwrite in the Miami region. Therefore, we
need to use the obtained Landmark Preservation Model to consider the
most suitable preservation plan for this historic landmark building.</p>
<h3 id="conclusions-obtained-by-the-landmark-preservation-model">Conclusions

<p>Based on the obtained results and the decision flowchart, the
suitable preservation plan for Vizcaya Museum and Gardens includes the
following:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Structural strengthening measures are necessary to ensure the
safety of the building. For instance, steel beams or reinforced concrete
can be added to the building to reinforce its structural
integrity.</p></li>
<li><p>Specific weather hazard protection measures are required; for
instance, hurricane-resistant windows and doors can be installed to
protect the building from harsh weather conditions.</p></li>
<li><p>Relocation should be considered when necessary; for example, if
the building is located in a high-risk area for natural disasters, it
may be safer to relocate it to a less risky location.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>However, according to NOAA's intermediate-high sea-level-rise
predictions for the years 2060 and 2100<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18" role="doc-noteref"><sup>18</sup></a>,
the gardens will sink in 40 years. To make matters worse, typical
engineered adaptive measures, such as levees, flood walls, and many
flood-proofing techniques are not suitable for Vizcaya. There are no
current municipal plans for hard infrastructure improvements to help
protect Vizcaya Museum and Gardens from future storms or rising seas.<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19" role="doc-noteref"><sup>19</sup></a></p>
<p>Meanwhile, the insurance model for the Miami-Dade County area shows
that Vizcaya Museum and Gardens is located in a high-risk area where
insurance cannot be obtained. In such unfavorable conditions,
<strong>the best solution to protect this landmark is to relocate it to
a safer location</strong>. The one-page community letter is attached to
the page before the Appendices.</p>
<h1 id="sensitivity-analysis">Sensitivity Analysis</h1>
<h2 id="sensitivity-analysis-for-insurance-model">Sensitivity Analysis
for Insurance Model</h2>
<p>To execute a sensitivity investigation of the flood disaster severity
evaluation model, we held the other indices at their current values and
progressively enhanced the principle components, subsequently
calculating the alterations in the Weather Disaster Risk Index (WDRI)
consequential from this adjustment. The resulting data is illustrated in
Figure 13.</p>
<p><img src="https://s2.loli.net/2024/02/06/oXbpzfj4Jgl8xuF.png" alt="13.png"></p>
<p>The findings demonstrate that the WDRI is most notably affected when
'Rainfall' (RR) increases, denoting it has the most significant impact.
Conversely,less extreme impact of other variables suggest that these
elements, though important, have a comparatively smaller effect. From
these results, it's evident that flood disaster severity is most
sensitive to rainfall levels. This is consistent with the concrete
scenario, as rainfall is undeniably a central factor in determining the
intensity and likelihood of floods. Consequently, in devising disaster
mitigation strategies, the focus should primarily be on developing flood
control measures that can effectively deal with high rainfall
levels.</p>
<p>Lastly, our findings also suggest that the model is robust and can
reliably anticipate disaster severity, even in the face of minor data
errors. This feature enhances the model's practical applicability and
value in real-world disaster planning and management.</p>
<h2 id="sensitivity-analysis-for-landmark-preservation-model">Sensitivity
Analysis for Landmark Preservation Model</h2>
<p>To conduct a sensitivity analysis of the landmark preservation model,
we fixed the other indicators at their current values and incrementally
increased the principle components and then calculated the change in the
Landmark Weather Disaster Vulnerability Index (LWDVI) resulting from
this adjustment. The results are shown below in Figure 14.</p>
<p><img src="https://s2.loli.net/2024/02/06/DnZ9BcQ2RWMoYeU.png" alt="14.png"></p>
<p>The results indicate that the Landmark Weather Disaster Vulnerability
Index (LWDVI) is most significantly affected when the relevant
indicators change by the same proportion and the 3rd principal component
(PC3) increases when the index change ratio is less than 0.174. On the
other hand, the LWDVI is most significantly influenced by the change in
the 1st principal component (PC1) when the index change ratio is greater
than 0.174. This suggests that the LWDVI is most sensitive to the
inherent risk of the landmark building itself because both components
are related with the strength of the landmark. Therefore, under the
condition of limited funding and manpower, repairing and protecting the
landmark itself should be given the highest priority.</p>
<p>The result also shows the model is robust even if there're some
errors in data.</p>
<h1 id="model-evaluation-and-further-discussion">Model Evaluation and
Further Discussion</h1>
<h2 id="strengths">Strengths</h2>
<p><strong>Close to reality</strong>: Our research is based on a large
amount of real statistical data. For example, we obtained historical
hurricane data through the National Oceanic and Atmospheric
Administration (NOAA) and local property data through the University of
Florida's research institute.</p>
<p>The work references a large number of classic methods, as well as
innovative methods that have been verified in specific research fields.
For example, the MAHT model <a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20" role="doc-noteref"><sup>20</sup></a> referenced in Task 4
was developed by experienced experts and has been convincingly
validated. Therefore, our model is supported by sufficient data and
reasonable methodologies and can be considered a reasonable simulation
of the real world.</p>
<p><strong>Reasonableness</strong>: The Insurance Model can predict the
future trends of weather disasters based on historical data, providing
reasonable insurance advice and arrangements. The resulting real estate
location choices are reasonable and align well with our expectations and
actual circumstances. The Landmark Preservation Model accurately
captures the value and risks faced by historical buildings, guiding
decision-makers to make reasonable judgments. The simulation results are
all intuitive and consistent with reality, so the model is
reasonable.</p>
<p><strong>Humanistic Care &amp; Social Responsibility</strong>: When
setting insurance prices, the Insurance Model takes into account the
difficulties of local communities in the event of a disaster by
achieving a minimum Insurance Protection Gap, which reflects the sense
of social responsibility and care for people. The Landmark Preservation
Model, when assessing historic buildings, considers the satisfaction of
residents. It quantifies this as part of the model and makes it work,
doing its best to protect people's precious memories. Therefore the
model also takes into account humanistic care and social
responsibility.</p>
<p><strong>Objective</strong>: The entropy weighting method is used to
determine the weights of indicators, avoiding the influence of personal
subjective factors.</p>
<p><strong>Robustness</strong>: The sensitivity analysis shows that our
model can still output good results when faced with biased data. It has
a strong resistance to data errors and demonstrates a certain robustness
and stability.</p>
<h2 id="weaknesses">Weaknesses</h2>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>The Landmark Preservation Model does not have a comprehensive
consideration of economic effects, so it still has limitations in
practical application.</p></li>
<li><p>There is potential for enhancement in our selection of
indicators, and certain indicators could be represented with more
suitable and sufficient data.</p></li>
</ol>
<h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>
<p>We propose a multi-factor model of insurance which takes into account
three main aspects: weather disaster risks, section risk factors and
style risk factors. This model has been used to solve problems from
twodifferent continents, demonstrating its powerful generality and
adaptability. It is also used to assist insurance companies in
formulating insurance strategies and helping real estate companies adapt
to future changes. It has strong versatility and can help people in
various industries.</p>
<p>We have also developed a Landmark Preservation Model based on the
latest research results called MAHT. It considers four influencing
factors: extreme weather risk exposure to the landmark, its
vulnerability, people's satisfaction with it, and its historical and
cultural significance. By categorizing these factors, we obtained
numerical values to assess the necessity of protecting the landmark and
created a decision flowchart to assist decision-makers in formulating
different protection measures based on the circumstances. This model was
used to analyze the preservation measures for the Vizcaya Museum and
Gardens and, based on the results, a community letter was written to
local residents. It can make significant contributions in the aspect of
community heritage preservation.</p>
<h1 id="community-letter">Community Letter</h1>
<p>February 4th, 2024</p>
<p>Dear residents of Miami-Dade County,</p>
<p>We hope this letter finds you well and thriving in our vibrant
community. Today, We write to you with a matter of great importance
concerning one of our most cherished local landmarks, the Vizcaya Museum
and Gardens.</p>
<p>As many of you are aware, the Vizcaya Museum and Gardens suffered
substantial damage during Hurricane Irma in 2017. The increasing threat
of rising sea levels and frequent hurricanes, coupled with unsuitable
repairment conditions, have put this iconic landmark at significant
risk. After thorough consideration with calculations through our
Landmark Preservation Model, the recommendation has been made for the
relocation to ensure its preservation for future generations.</p>
<p>The cost of relocating such a significant site is substantial, and
preliminary calculations suggest that the entire project is about 80
million dollars, considering the difficulties in relocating and
preserving. The financial burden will be borne by government. Donations
are welcome during the whole process, and every donation, no matter the
size, will play a crucial role in safeguarding a piece of our shared
heritage.</p>
<p>The relocation and preservation project will be managed by
professional companies, ensuring that every aspect of Vizcaya is handled
with the utmost care and expertise. The project is planned to unfold in
five phases over the next five years, outlined as follows:</p>
<p>Phase 1: Planning and Fund Collecting - A detailed planning will be
finalized and the initial funding will be secured. (6 months)</p>
<p>Phase 2: Preparing - New foundations will be prepared well. At the
same time, stabilization works to ensure minimal damage will be done to
the building. (18 months)</p>
<p>Phase 3: Initial Relocation Phase - Beginning the physical relocation
of smaller structures and artifacts, including small collectibles,
sculptures, plants, and so on. (12 months)</p>
<p>Phase 4: Main Relocation Phase - Relocating the Main House and larger
structures, alongside significant restoration works. (12 months)</p>
<p>Phase 5: Finalization and Restoration - Completing the relocation,
with a focus on restoration, landscaping, and public reopening. (12
months)</p>
<p>We extend our deepest gratitude for your love for Vizcaya and invite
you to be a part of this monumental effort to preserve our history and
culture. It is this collective passion that has kept Vizcaya's spirit
alive through challenging times, and it is this same passion that we
call upon now to ensure its future. It takes a village, but it's worth
it.</p>
<p>Thank you for your attention and support.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>COMAP's Insurance of Catastrophes Modelers (ICM)</p>

<h2 id="calculation-details-of-the-maht-model">Calculation Details of
the MAHT Model</h2>
<p>According to the existing study <a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21" role="doc-noteref"><sup>21</sup></a>, we can obtain the
design thinking and calculation methods behind the MAHT model. For the
sake of simplicity, this part has been used multiple times in the main
text's Landmark Preservation Model, but it has not given specific
calculations for HA, SC, and RS, as well as the relevant evaluation
criteria. Therefore, it is supplemented in the appendix for future
reference.</p>
<p>The MAHT's first dimension considers the Heritage Attributes (HA) of
the urban landmark, which identifies the physical features and
constructive characteristics of urban fabrics. Its second dimension
evaluates Safety Conditions (SC), which identifies the presence of
damage, malfunction, and fire dysfunctional conditions. Also, its third
dimension considers Residential Satisfaction (RS),which is assessed
through face-to-face interviews.</p>
<p>The detailed sub-indicators with weights designed by experienced
specialists are listed below.</p>
